# Ruby on Rails Friends App

### Introduction
This is a Ruby on Rails exercise App created following the [tutorial](https://youtu.be/fmyvWz5TUWg) from YouTube. I had 
a lot of fun learning Ruby on Rails basics and playing around with both front-end and back-end tech stacks.

#### Topics covered
- How to start a Ruby on Rails app
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern
- "Scaffolding" - generate basic structure quickly to create database and front-end code that allow users to perform 
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Use Devise gem to generate user registration and login system
- Playing around with embedded Ruby and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for front-end
- Database associations in Active Record
- Playing around with controller for back-end operations
